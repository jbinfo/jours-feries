### The Revolution of the King and the People: 71st Anniversary Celebration (2024)

The *Revolution of the King and the People*, commemorated every year in Morocco on August 20th, is one of the most significant national holidays. It marks the unity and solidarity between King Mohammed V and the Moroccan people during their struggle against French colonial rule in the mid-20th century. The 71st anniversary, celebrated in 2024, is a time to reflect on Morocco’s rich history of resistance and the deep connection between the monarchy and its people, a bond that has shaped the modern Moroccan state.

#### Historical Background

The Revolution of the King and the People originated during the colonial period when Morocco was under French and Spanish control. In the early 1950s, growing nationalist movements pushed for Moroccan independence, with King Mohammed V becoming the symbol of national resistance. The crisis escalated on August 20, 1953, when the French authorities, seeking to suppress the movement for independence, forced King Mohammed V into exile along with his family.

Rather than weakening the nationalist cause, the exile of the beloved king sparked a strong wave of resistance. The Moroccan people rose in defiance of the colonial powers, refusing to accept the legitimacy of the French-appointed puppet government. The unity between the monarch and the people, with their shared goal of ending foreign rule, deepened during this time.

After nearly two years of growing unrest and international pressure, King Mohammed V was allowed to return to Morocco in November 1955. His return was seen as a major victory and paved the way for Morocco's independence, which was officially declared in March 1956.

#### Traditions and Events on the Day

Every year, the anniversary of this pivotal event is marked with patriotic fervor across the country. The day is not only a reminder of the historic bond between the monarchy and the people but also a celebration of Moroccan identity, freedom, and sovereignty.
