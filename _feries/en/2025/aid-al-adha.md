Eid al-Adha, celebrated across the Muslim world, holds special significance in Morocco as a religious and cultural event. The holiday takes place on the 10th day of Dhul-Hijja, following the culmination of the pilgrimage to Mecca. It commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son in obedience to God, marking the occasion with the symbolic act of sacrificing an animal. In Morocco, this day is celebrated with rich traditions and customs, blending religious practices with deep-rooted social values.

### Preparations for Eid

In the days leading up to Eid, Moroccan markets, known as **"rahbas"**, become lively hubs of activity as people search for the perfect animal to sacrifice. These markets serve as a meeting place for livestock traders and buyers, with sheep, goats, and cattle being the most common choices. Purchasing the sacrificial animal is a thoughtful process for Moroccan families, who carefully select one that aligns with both their financial means and religious criteria.

A significant tradition associated with the holiday is fasting on the day before Eid, known as the Day of Arafah. While this practice is not obligatory, it is a spiritual preparation for the coming celebrations. Beyond spiritual readiness, physical preparations also take place as homes are cleaned, and special ingredients are bought for the festive meals that will be shared with family and friends, featuring traditional dishes such as **mrouzia** and couscous with lamb.

### The Day of Eid

Eid day begins with a communal prayer at the mosque, where families and neighbors gather to offer thanks and prayers. Following the prayer, the sacrificial ritual takes place. This moment is sacred, symbolizing submission to God and a reminder of the story of Ibrahim. After the animal is slaughtered, its meat is divided into three portions: one for the family, one for relatives and friends, and the final part is given to those in need. This practice reinforces the values of charity, generosity, and solidarity that define this religious occasion.

### Evolution of Eid Traditions

Over time, the way Eid al-Adha is celebrated in Morocco has undergone significant changes, especially in urban areas. In the past, many Moroccan families, particularly in rural settings, raised their livestock specifically for the holiday. With the increase in urbanization and the shift in lifestyle, the practice of raising animals for the occasion has diminished. Most families now purchase their sacrificial animals from local markets, reflecting a broader shift in how the holiday is approached in modern times.

The process of slaughtering the animal has also evolved. While it was once primarily done by the head of the household, many families now hire professional butchers to ensure the ritual is performed according to religious guidelines. This trend reflects the growing professionalism in the meat trade and the increasing demand for ensuring compliance with religious standards.

### Impact of Drought on Livestock

In recent years, Morocco has faced recurring droughts that have had a profound effect on agriculture and livestock farming. The scarcity of water and reduced availability of pasture have led to rising costs of animal feed, making it increasingly expensive to raise livestock. This has resulted in higher prices for sacrificial animals in the markets, putting financial strain on many families wishing to partake in the tradition.

In response, the Moroccan government has implemented several measures to support livestock farmers. Subsidies for animal feed and programs aimed at improving the sustainability of livestock farming have been introduced to help mitigate the impact of drought. These initiatives are intended to stabilize the livestock market, ensuring that families can continue to participate in the holidayâ€™s rituals despite the environmental challenges.

Eid al-Adha remains a cherished religious and cultural event in Morocco, embodying the values of faith, charity, and community. Despite the challenges posed by changing lifestyles and environmental issues such as drought, Moroccans continue to adapt and preserve the essence of this celebration. The combination of tradition and modern adaptation ensures that Eid al-Adha remains a central part of Moroccan life, connecting the past with the present in meaningful ways.
