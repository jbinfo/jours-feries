Morocco’s National Day, celebrated on November 18, marks a significant historical milestone: the end of foreign domination and the restoration of national sovereignty in 1956. This day commemorates the triumph of the Moroccan people's long struggle for freedom and symbolizes a turning point in the country's modern history.

### Key Events Leading to the Liberation

The road to full sovereignty was marked by various struggles and diplomatic negotiations. In the 1920s, the emergence of the nationalist movement laid the groundwork for a broader push against foreign control. The 1944 submission of the "Manifesto of Independence" to the French authorities was a pivotal moment, as it demanded the liberation of Morocco and the establishment of a sovereign state under the leadership of Sultan Mohammed V.

However, the French authorities resisted these calls for freedom, leading to rising tensions. In 1953, the French authorities exiled Sultan Mohammed V, an event that sparked widespread outrage among the Moroccan people. This move unified the population, accelerating the struggle against colonialism. Ultimately, through a combination of popular resistance and diplomatic negotiations, the Sultan was restored to the throne in 1955, opening the way for full sovereignty the following year.

### Development in Morocco After Sovereignty

Since regaining its autonomy, Morocco has undergone significant transformation, evolving into a modern nation with robust institutions. The early decades after independence were focused on consolidating state foundations, with an emphasis on education, agriculture, and basic infrastructure.

In recent years, Morocco has embraced diversification of its economy and expanded its global connections. The country has undertaken major development projects in various sectors. Notably, the construction of the Tanger Med port has positioned Morocco as a critical logistical hub linking Europe and Africa, while efforts in renewable energy, such as the Noor Solar Power Plant in Ouarzazate, have signaled Morocco's commitment to sustainable development.

Simultaneously, Morocco has made strides in education and healthcare, implementing reforms aimed at improving access to services and enhancing the quality of public infrastructure. Social justice and efforts to reduce disparities have also been at the forefront of the government's priorities, with initiatives like the National Human Development Initiative targeting poverty reduction and regional inequalities.

### Major Development Projects

Over the past decades, Morocco has seen the realization of several ambitious projects that have played a key role in its development.

1. **Tanger Med Port**: This modern port has become one of the largest in the Mediterranean and Africa, acting as a crucial player in international trade and driving economic growth in northern Morocco.
   
2. **Renewable Energy**: Morocco has emerged as a leader in green energy, particularly through the Noor Solar Complex, which stands as one of the world’s largest solar energy projects. This is a clear demonstration of the country’s ambition to achieve energy independence through sustainable means.

3. **Transport Infrastructure**: The launch of the high-speed train “Al Boraq” between Tangier and Casablanca marked a significant step in improving the nation’s transportation network, reducing travel time between major cities and enhancing connectivity.

4. **New Cities**: Morocco has launched several urban development plans, creating new cities like Tamesna and Chrafate to manage population growth and alleviate pressure on major urban centers.

### Comparing the Past and Present

In the early years following the end of foreign control, Morocco faced significant challenges: limited infrastructure, restricted access to education, and underdeveloped healthcare services. However, over the decades, the country has capitalized on its human and natural resources to stimulate economic development.

Today, Morocco is recognized for its political stability, diversified economy, and forward-looking projects. The country has become a key player in regional and international trade while maintaining a focus on social justice and reducing inequalities.

### Conclusion

Morocco’s National Day is not only a reminder of the country’s historic victory against foreign rule but also a reflection on the progress made since then. Through visionary initiatives and a steadfast commitment to sustainable development, Morocco continues to strengthen its position as a model of progress in the region.
