### The 72nd Anniversary of the Revolution of the King and the People: Tradition and Events in 2025

The Revolution of the King and the People is one of Morocco’s most significant national holidays, celebrated annually on **August 20th**. It commemorates the solidarity and resilience shown by King Mohammed V and the Moroccan people in the struggle against French colonial rule.

Two years later, in 1955, King Mohammed V returned triumphantly, signaling the beginning of the end for French colonial control. His return became symbolic of the unbreakable bond between the monarchy and the people, a defining moment that led to Morocco’s independence in 1956.
